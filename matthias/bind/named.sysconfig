# Currently, you can use the following options:
# ROOTDIR="/some/where"  --  will run named in a chroot environment.
#                            you must set up the chroot environment before
#                            doing this.
# OPTIONS="whatever" -- These additional options will be passed to named
#                       at startup. Don't add -t here, use ROOTDIR instead.
