# Pine system-wide defaults file -- customize as needed.
#
# This file sets the system-wide configuration defaults used by Pine.
# If you have questions about specific settings see the section on
# configuration options in the Pine notes. Run pine -conf to see how
# system defaults have been set.  For variables that accept multiple
# values, list elements are separated by commas.  A line beginning with
# a space or tab is considered to be a continuation of the previous line.
# For a variable to be unset its value must be blank.
# To set a variable to the empty string its value should be "".
# Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and default to
# "no".  Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.
