+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
+because the original program does not have a manual page.
+.PP
+.B type1afm
+reads in Type 1 font files specified on the command line, rasterizes
+them to 1000bp, and writes AFM (font metrics) files based on the
+observed metrics information.
+.PP
+The AFM file is created in the same directory as the font file, so be
+sure that you have write access there before running this program.

+.TH XGLYPH 1
+.SH NAME
+xglyph \- demonstration program for the t1lib font rasterizer library.
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B xglyph
+[
+.B fontfile...
+]
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.BR xglyph
+program.
+This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
+because the original program does not have a manual page.
+.PP
+.B xglyph
+is a program which demonstrates the capabilities of the
+.B t1lib
+library.  It allows the user to view an arbitrary character or string
+rendered in the various ways pgossible with the library.  By default,
+it writes a log file named \fIt1lib.log\fR in the current directory.
+.PP
+If invoked with no arguments, it will attempt to read the global
+configuration file and font database.  It will also accept any number
+of filenames on the command line, in which case these are treated as
+font files to be loaded instead of the default font database.

+.B xglyph
+is much more fully documented in the LaTeX documentation that

+distribution.  This documentation is installed in PostScript and source
+formats with the t1lib-dev package in /usr/share/doc/t1lib-dev, and is

+.TH FONTDATABASE 5
+.SH NAME
+FontDataBase \- database of fonts accessible to t1lib.
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page has been written for the Debian GNU/Linux
+distribution.  It has been adapted from the documentation included in
+the upstream
+.B t1lib
+distribution.
+.PP
+.B /etc/t1lib/FontDataBase
+is a text file which contains, minimally, the basenames of Type 1 font 
+files to be made accessible to the
+.B t1lib
+font rasterizer library.  The format is intentionally similar to that
+of the
+.B fonts.dir
+and
+.B fonts.scale
+files used by X11.
+.PP
+Line 1 of this file contains a positive integer specifying the number
+of fonts declared in that file. This is as in the
+.B fonts.dir
+files of the X11 system.
+.PP
+All remaining lines contain declarations of one font each. The only
+thing taken from such a line is the last string (delimited by white
+space) in it. It is assumed to be a filename of the format
+\fIbasename\fR.\fIsomeextension\fR.
+.PP
+The \fIbasename\fR part is assumed to be the
+.BR basename (1)
+of a fontfile.  After the a string has been parsed, the
+.I extension
+is cut off and replaced in turn with
+.I .pfa
+and
+.I .pfb.
+The initialization routine tries to open a font file in
+its search path with one of the resulting filenames.
+.PP
+The remainder of the line, i.e., from beginning to the start of the
+filename string, is completely ignored and thus may contain
+information for other programs.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+Here is a minimal font database file for 4 fonts:
+.sp
+.nf
+4
+isvl.afm
+isvli.afm
+isvd.afm
+isvdi.afm
+.fi
+.PP
+This file is \fIminimal\fR, because it contains just the information
+needed, and nothing not needed by the library. 
+.PP
+Here is a more realistic example, which allows an application to match
+a fully qualified X11 fontname to a FontID in
+.B t1lib.
+This is also a valid font database file:
+.sp
+.nf
+4
+Souvenir Souvenir-Light       --- -itc-souvenir-light-r-normal--#-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1 isvl.afm
