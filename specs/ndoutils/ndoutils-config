## TABLE TRIMMING OPTIONS
# Several database tables containing Nagios event data can become quite large
# over time.  Most admins will want to trim these tables and keep only a
# certain amount of data in them.  The options below are used to specify the
# age (in MINUTES) that data should be allowd to remain in various tables
# before it is deleted.  Using a value of zero (0) for any value means that
# that particular table should NOT be automatically trimmed.

# Keep timed events for 24 hours
max_timedevents_age=1440

# Keep system commands for 1 week
max_systemcommands_age=10080

# Keep service checks for 1 week
max_servicechecks_age=10080

# Keep host checks for 1 week
max_hostchecks_age=10080

# Keep event handlers for 31 days
max_eventhandlers_age=44640





# DEBUG LEVEL

# This option determines the maximum size (in bytes) of the debug file.  If
# the file grows larger than this size, it will be renamed with a .old
# extension.  If a file already exists with a .old extension it will
# automatically be deleted.  This helps ensure your disk space usage doesn't
# get out of control when debugging.

max_debug_file_size=1000000
