+LDAP Support in DHCP
+Brian Masney <masneyb@ntelos.net>
+Last updated 3/23/2003
+
+This document describes setting up the DHCP server to read it's configuration 
+from LDAP. This work is based on the IETF document 
+draft-ietf-dhc-ldap-schema-01.txt included in the doc directory. For the latest
+version of this document, please see http://home.ntelos.net/~masneyb.
+
+First question on most people's mind is "Why do I want to store my 
+configuration in LDAP?" If you run a small DHCP server, and the configuration
+on it rarely changes, then you won't need to store your configuration in LDAP.
+But, if you have several DHCP servers, and you want an easy way to manage your 
+configuration, this can be a solution. 
+
+The first step will be to setup your LDAP server. I am using OpenLDAP from
+www.openldap.org. Building and installing OpenLDAP is beyond the scope of this 
+document. There is plenty of documentation out there about this. Once you have 
+OpenLDAP installed, you will have to edit your slapd.conf file. I added the 
+following 2 lines to my configuration file:
+
+include         /etc/ldap/schema/dhcp.schema
+index           dhcpHWAddress 	eq
+index           dhcpClassData	eq
+
+The first line tells it to include the dhcp schema file. You will find this 
+file under the contrib directory in this distribution. You will need to copy 
+this file to where your other schema files are (maybe
+/usr/local/openldap/etc/openldap/schema/). The second line sets up
+an index for the dhcpHWAddress parameter. The third parameter is for reading 
+subclasses from LDAP every time a DHCP request comes in. Make sure you run the 
+slapindex command and restart slapd to have these changes to into effect.
+
+Now that you have LDAP setup, you should be able to use gq (http://biot.com/gq/)
+to verify that the dhcp schema file is loaded into LDAP. Pull up gq, and click
+on the Schema tab. Go under objectClasses, and you should see at least the 
+following object classes listed: dhcpClass, dhcpGroup, dhcpHost, dhcpOptions, 
+dhcpPool, dhcpServer, dhcpService, dhcpSharedNetwork, dhcpSubClass, and 
+dhcpSubnet. If you do not see these, you need to check over your LDAP 
+configuration before you go any further.
+
+You should now be ready to build DHCP. If you would like to enable LDAP over
+SSL, you will need to perform the following steps:
+
+  * Edit the includes/site.h file and uncomment the USE_SSL line
+    or specify "-DUSE_SSL" via CFLAGS.
+  * Edit the dst/Makefile.dist file and remove md5_dgst.c and md5_dgst.o
+    from the SRC= and OBJ= lines (around line 24)
+  * Now run configure in the base source directory. If you chose to enable
+    LDAP over SSL, you must append -lcrypto -lssl to the LIBS= line in the file
+    work.os/server/Makefile (replace os with your operating system, linux-2.2 on
+    my machine).  You should now be able to type make to build your DHCP server.
+
+If you choose to not enable LDAP over SSL, then you only need to run configure
+and make in the toplevel source directory.
+
+Once you have DHCP installed, you will need to setup your initial plaintext 
+config file. In my /etc/dhcpd.conf file, I have:
+
+ldap-server "localhost";
+ldap-port 389;
+ldap-username "cn=DHCP User, dc=ntelos, dc=net";
+ldap-password "blah";
+ldap-base-dn "dc=ntelos, dc=net";
+ldap-method dynamic;
+ldap-debug-file "/var/log/dhcp-ldap-startup.log";
+
+If SSL has been enabled at compile time using the USE_SSL flag, the dhcp
+server trys to use TLS if possible, but continues without TLS if not.
+
+You can modify this behaviour using following option in /etc/dhcpd.conf:
+
+ldap-ssl <off | ldaps | start_tls | on>
+   off:       disables TLS/LDAPS.
+   ldaps:     enables LDAPS -- don't forget to set ldap-port to 636.
+   start_tls: enables TLS using START_TLS command
+   on:        enables LDAPS if ldap-port is set to 636 or TLS in 
+              other cases.
+
+See also "man 5 ldap.conf" for description the following TLS related 
+options:
+   ldap-tls-reqcert, ldap-tls-ca-file, ldap-tls-ca-dir, ldap-tls-cert
+   ldap-tls-key, ldap-tls-crlcheck, ldap-tls-ciphers, ldap-tls-randfile
+
+All of these parameters should be self explanatory except for the ldap-method.
+You can set this to static or dynamic. If you set it to static, the 
+configuration is read once on startup, and LDAP isn't used anymore. But, if you
+set this to dynamic, the configuration is read once on startup, and the 
+hosts that are stored in LDAP are looked up every time a DHCP request comes in.
+
+When the optional statement ldap-debug-file is specified, on startup the DHCP
+server will write out the configuration that it generated from LDAP. If you are
+getting errors about your LDAP configuration, this is a good place to start
+looking.
+
+The next step is to set up your LDAP tree. Here is an example config that will
+give a 10.100.0.x address to machines that have a host entry in LDAP. 
+Otherwise, it will give a 10.200.0.x address to them. (NOTE: replace 
+dc=ntelos, dc=net with your base dn). If you would like to convert your 
+existing dhcpd.conf file to LDIF format, there is a script 
+contrib/dhcpd-conf-to-ldap.pl that will convert it for you. Type
+dhcpd-conf-to-ldap.pl --help to see the usage information for this script.
+
+# You must specify the server's host name in LDAP that you are going to run
+# DHCP on and point it to which config tree you want to use. Whenever DHCP 
+# first starts up, it will do a search for this entry to find out which 
+# config to use

+
+You can use the command slapadd to load all of these entries into your LDAP 
+server. After you load this, you should be able to start up DHCP. If you run
+into problems reading the configuration, try running dhcpd with the -d flag. 
+If you still have problems, edit the site.conf file in the DHCP source and
+add the line: COPTS= -DDEBUG_LDAP and recompile DHCP. (make sure you run make 
+clean and rerun configure before you rebuild).

+# To use this script, set your base DN below. Then run 
+# ./dhcpd-conf-to-ldap.pl < /path-to-dhcpd-conf/dhcpd.conf > output-file
+# The output of this script will generate entries in LDIF format. You can use
+# the slapadd command to add these entries into your LDAP server. You will
+# definately want to double check that your LDAP entries are correct before
+# you load them into LDAP.
+
+# This script does not do much error checking. Make sure before you run this
+# that the DHCP server doesn't give any errors about your config file
+
+# FailOver notes:
+#   Failover is disabled by default, since it may need manually intervention.
+#   You can try the '--use=failover' option to see what happens :-)
+#
+#   If enabled, the failover pool references will be written to LDIF output.
+#   The failover configs itself will be added to the dhcpServer statements
+#   and not to the dhcpService object (since this script uses only one and
+#   it may be usefull to have multiple service containers in failover mode).
+#   Further, this script does not check if primary or secondary makes sense,
+#   it simply converts what it gets...

+1. Abstract
+
+This document defines a schema for representing DHCP configuration in an
+LDAP directory. It can be used to represent the DHCP Service
+configuration(s) for an entire enterprise network, a subset of the
+network, or even a single server. Representing DHCP configuration in an
+LDAP directory enables centralized management of DHCP services offered
+by one or more DHCP Servers within the enterprise.
+
+2. Conventions used in this document
+
+The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
+"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
+document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [ ].
+
+In places where different sets of terminology are commonly used to
+represent similar DHCP concepts, this schema uses the terminology of the
+Internet Software Consortium's DHCP server reference implementation.

+INTERNET-DRAFT            LDAP Schema for DHCP              16 June 2001
+
+
+intent of this schema is to provide a basic framework for representing
+the most common elements used in the configuration of DHCP Server.  This
+should allow other network services to obtain and use basic DHCP
+configuration information in a server-independent but knowledgeable way.
+
+It is expected that some implementations may need to extend the schema
+objects, in order to implement all of their features or needs. It is
+recommended that you use the schema defined in this draft to represent
+DHCP configuration information in an LDAP directory.  Conforming to a
+standard schema improves interoperability between DHCP implementations
+from different vendors.
+
+Some implementations may choose not to support all of the objects
+defined here.
+
+Two decisions are explicitly left up to each implementation:
+
+First, implementations may choose not to store the lease information in
+the directory, so those objects would not be used.
+
+Second, implementations may choose not to implement the auditing
+information.
+
+It is up to the implementation to determine if the data in the directory
+is considered "authoritative", or if it is simply a copy of data from an
+authoritative source. Validity of the information if used as a copy is
+to be ensured by the implementation.
+
+Primarily two types of applications will use the information in this
+schema: 1. DHCP servers (for loading their configuration) 2. Management
+Interfaces (for defining/editing configurations).
+
+The schema should be efficient for the needs of both types of
+applications.  The schema is designed to allow objects managed by DHCP
+(such as computers, subnets, etc) to be present anywhere in a directory
+hierarchy (to allow those objects to be placed in the directory for
+managing administrative control and access to the objects).
+
+The schema uses a few naming conventions - all object classes and
+attributes are prefixed with "dhcp" to decrease the chance that object
+classes and attributes will have the same name.  The schema also uses
+standard naming attributes ("cn", "ou", etc) for all objects.
+
+4. Common DHCP Configuration Attributes
+
+Although DHCP manages several different types of objects, the
+configuration of those objects is often similar.  Consequently, most of
+these objects have a common set of attributes, which are defined below.

+5. Configurations and Services
+
+The schema definitions below are for readability the LDIF layout for
+this schema will follow in section 8.
+
+The DHC working group is currently considering several proposals for
+fail-over and redundancy of DHCP servers.  These may require sharing of
+configuration information between servers.  This schema provides a
+generalized mechanism for supporting any of these proposals, by
+separating the definition of a server from the definition of
+configuration service provided by the server.
+
+Separating the DHCP Server (dhcpServer) and the DHCP Configuration
+(dhcpService) representations allows a configuration service to be
+provided by one or more servers. Similarly, a server may provide one or
+more configurations. The schema allows a server to be configured as
+either a primary or secondary provider of a DHCP configuration.
+
+Configurations are also defined so that one configuration can include
+some of the objects that are defined in another configuration.  This
+allows for sharing and/or a hierarchy of related configuration items.
+
+Name: dhcpService Description:  Service object that represents the
+actual DHCP Service configuration. This will be a container with the
+following attributes.  Must: cn, dhcpPrimaryDN May: dhcpSecondaryDN,
+dhcpSharedNetworkDN, dhcpSubnetDN, dhcpGroupDN, dhcpHostDN,
+dhcpClassesDN, dhcpOptionsDN, dhcpStatements
+
+The following objects could exist inside the dhcpService container:
+dhcpSharedNetwork, dhcpSubnet, dhcpGroup, dhcpHost, dhcpClass,
+dhcpOptions, dhcpLog
+
+Name: dhcpServer Description:  Server object that the DHCP server will
+login as.  The configuration information is in the dhcpService container
+that the dhcpServiceDN points to.  Must: cn, dhcpServiceDN May:
+dhcpVersion, dhcpImplementation, dhcpHashBucketAssignment,
+dhcpDelayedServiceParameter, dhcpMaxClientLeadTime,

+
+6. Tracking Address Assignments
+
+The behavior of a DHCP server is influenced by two factors - it's
+configuration and the current state of the addresses that have been
+assigned to clients. This schema defines a set of objects for
+representing the DHCP configuration associated with a server. The
+following object classes provide the ability to record how addresses are
+used including maintaining history (audit log) on individual leases.
+Recording lease information in a directory could result in a significant
+performance impact and is therefore optional. Implementations supporting
+logging of leases need to consider the performance impact.
+
+6.1. dhcpLeases Attribute Definitions
+
+The schema definitions below are for readability the LDIF layout for
+this schema will follow in section 8.
+
+Name: dhcpAddressState Description: This stores information about the
+current binding-status of an address.  For dynamic addresses managed by
+DHCP, the values should be restricted to the states defined in the DHCP
+Failover Protocol draft [FAILOVR]: 'FREE', 'ACTIVE', 'EXPIRED',
+'RELEASED', 'RESET', 'ABANDONED', 'BACKUP'.  For more information on
+these states see [FAILOVR].  For other addresses, it SHOULD be one of
+the following: 'UNKNOWN', 'RESERVED' (an address that is managed by DHCP
+that is reserved for a specific client), 'RESERVED-ACTIVE' (same as
+reserved, but address is currently in use),  'ASSIGNED' (assigned
+manually or by some other mechanism), 'UNASSIGNED', 'NOTASSIGNABLE'.
+Syntax: IA5String Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpExpirationTime Description: This is the time the current lease
+for an address expires.  Syntax: DateTime Flags: SINGLE-VALUE

+
+INTERNET-DRAFT            LDAP Schema for DHCP              16 June 2001
+
+
+Name: dhcpStartTimeOfState Description: This is the time of the last
+state change for a leased address.  Syntax: DateTime Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpLastTransactionTime Description: This is the last time a valid
+DHCP packet was received from the client.  Syntax: DateTime Flags:
+SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpBootpFlag Description: This indicates whether the address was
+assigned via BOOTP Syntax: Boolean Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpDomainName Description: This is the name of the domain sent to
+the client by the server.  It is essentially the same as the value for
+DHCP option 15 sent to the client, and represents only the domain - not
+the full FQDN.  To obtain the full FQDN assigned to the client you must
+prepend the "dhcpAssignedHostName" to this value with a ".".  Syntax:
+IA5String Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpDnsStatus Description: This indicates the status of updating
+DNS resource records on behalf of the client by the DHCP server for this
+address.  The value is a 16-bit bitmask that has the same values as
+specified by the Failover-DDNS option (see [FAILOVR]).  Syntax: Integer
+Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpRequestedHostName Description: This is the hostname that was
+requested by the client.  Syntax: IA5String Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpAssignedHostName Description: This is the actual hostname that
+was assigned to a client. It may not be the name that was requested by
+the client.  The fully qualified domain name can be determined by
+appending the value of "dhcpDomainName" (with a dot separator) to this
+name.  Syntax: IA5String Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpReservedForClient Description: This is the distinguished name
+of the "dhcpHost" that an address is reserved for.  This may not be the
+same as the "dhcpAssignedToClient" attribute if the address is being
+reassigned but the current lease has not yet expired.  Syntax: DN Flags:
+SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpAssignedToClient Description: This is the distinguished name
+of a "dhcpHost" that an address is currently assigned to.  This
+attribute is only present in the class when the address is leased.
+Syntax: DN Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpRelayAgentInfo Description: If the client request was received
+via a relay agent, this contains information about the relay agent that
+was available from the DHCP request.  This is a hex-encoded option
+value.  Syntax: OctetString Flags: SINGLE-VALUE
+
+Name: dhcpErrorLog Description: Generic error log attribute that allows
+logging error conditions within a dhcpService or a dhcpSubnet, like no IP 
+addresses available for lease. Syntax: IA5String

+
+6.2.  dhcpLeases Object Class
+
+This class represents an IP address.  It may or may not be leaseable,
+and the object may exist even though a lease is not currently active for
+the associated IP address.
+
+It is recommended that all Lease objects for a single DHCP Service be
+centrally located within a single container. This ensures that the lease
+objects and the corresponding logs do not have to be relocated, when
+address ranges allocated to individual DHCP subnets and/or pools change.
+
+The schema definitions below are for readability the LDIF layout for
+this schema will follow in section 8.
+
+Name: dhcpLeases Description: This is the object that holds state
+information about an IP address. The cn (which is the IP address), and
+the current address-state are mandatory attributes. If the address is
+assigned then, some of the optional attributes will have valid data.
+Must: cn, dhcpAddressState May: dhcpExpirationTime,
+dhcpStartTimeOfState, dhcpLastTransactionTime, dhcpBootpFlag,
+dhcpDomainName, dhcpDnsStatus, dhcpRequestedHostName,
+dhcpAssignedHostName, dhcpReservedForClient, dhcpAssignedToClient,
+dhcpRelayAgentInfo, dhcpHWAddress
+
+6.3 Audit Log Information
+
+A dhcpLog object is created whenever a lease is assigned or released.
+This object is intended to be created under the corresponding dhcpLeases
+container, or dhcpPool, dhcpSubnet, dhcpSharedNetwork or dhcpService
+containers.
+
+The log information under the dhcpLeases container would be for
+addresses matching that lease information. The log information in the
+other containers could be used for errors, i.e. when a pool or subnet is
+out our addresses or if a server is not able to assign any more
+addresses for a particular dhcpService.
+
+Name: dhcpLog Description: This is the object that holds past
+information about an IP address. The cn is the time/date stamp when the
+address was assigned or released, the address state at the time, if the
+address was assigned or released.  Must: cn May: dhcpAddressState,
+dhcpExpirationTime, dhcpStartTimeOfState, dhcpLastTransactionTime,
+dhcpBootpFlag, dhcpDomainName, dhcpDnsStatus, dhcpRequestedHostName,
+dhcpAssignedHostName, dhcpReservedForClient, dhcpAssignedToClient,
+dhcpRelayAgentInfo, dhcpHWAddress, dhcpErrorLog

+7. Determining settings
+
+The dhcpStatements attribute is the key to DHC enhancements that may
+come along, and the different key words that a particular server
+implementation may use. This attribute can be used to hold conditional
+DHCP Statements and DHCP server parameters. Having a generic settings
+attribute that is just a string, allows this schema to be extensible and
+easy to configure.
+
+All of the attributes that end with DN are references to the class that
+precedes the DN e.g. the dhcpPrimaryDN and dhcpSecondaryDN attributes
+hold the Distinguished Names of the dhcpServer objects that are
+associated with the dhcpService object.
